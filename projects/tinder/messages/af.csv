'Ja dat is waar.'
'Nee, ik heb stage.'
'Waarom was je gestopt?'
'En is dat bewust ? Of gewoon nog niemand tegengekomen?'
'Ik nu ook wel veeeeel minder. Enkel nog voor de actualiteit wat te volgen.'
'Dat vind ik goed 😃'
'Slaapwel! ☺️'
'Raar vak'
'Ja wie weet haha'
'Gewoon wat saai'
'Ik was al gaan slapen 😃'
'Dan ga je HIMYM ook goe vinden! 😃'
'Dat is goed!'
'Ja, Ik had stage eh, vandaar dat ik zo verast was dat het nog wel leuk was 😁'
'Ja je hebt nog wel twee jaar eh 😃'
'Jup, en dan nog eens twee jaar'
'Dus terug 3 jaar 😅'
'En nee, ik ga naar Leuven gaan.'
'Waarom is dat?😃'
'Alleee, er is nog hoop dan 😂'
'En ooooooh, ik ben jaloers.'
'Oké top. Dus ik ga je enkele stellingen geven en jij moet aangeven in welke mate je akkoord bent. De antwoordopties variëren van 1 tot 5. Waarbij&colon;\n1= helemaal akkoord \n2 = akkoord\n3 = neutraal\n4 = niet akkoord\n5 = helemaal niet akkoord'
'1. ik gebruik snel geweld\n2. Ik word snel kwaad\n3. Ik ben iemand die snel jaloers is\n4. Ik vind het leuk dat andere mensen pijn hebben\n5. Ik vind Robbe van Tinder een mooie jongen\n6. Ik wil wel eens op date met Robbe'
'Euhm.. wat bedoelde daar mee?'
'Ik doe arbeids en organisatie psychologie'
'Wat is dat?'
'Ik denk niet dat ik daar ga geraken'
'Ik geloof er niks van'
'Ik wil vandaag ook anders wel uitgaan'
'Ja enkel daarom. Ik heb hoge standaarden met betrekking ‘leukheid&rsquo; dus op dit moment moet ik u nog beter leren kennen voordat ik hier uitspraken over kan doen.'
'Ja, dat is een inside joke'
'Uiteraard'
'Dit jaar nog niet nee. Volgend jaar wel'
'U ken ik van ergens 😉'
'Wat vond ge daarvan?'
'Maar in geloof u niet haha'
'En ik wil daarna een uitvoerend verslag.'
'Kwestie van het wat in balans te houden.'
'En ik weet het niet. Soms we grappig maar ik vind het ook soms wat saai'
'Wat is dan wel goed?'
'Oké, hoe is dit&colon;'
'‘Hallo, wat is uw lievelingskleur?&rsquo;'
'Er is nog hoop'
'En wat ben ik dan ? 😁'
'Ahja, anders ben ik ook niet gemotiveerd.'
'Ja dat is handig'
'Ik ga volgend jaar ook op kot in Leuven &colon;&rpar;'
'Is dat ook 2 jaar?'
'Ah ja daar kan ik nog met leven.'
'Dag Kaat'
'Hoe is u weekend geweest ?'
'Klopt, maar ik vraag advies aan u'
'Om 6u30 opstaan dan 😲'
'Ik ben van Koningshooikt dus dan zou ik naar Lier gaan.'
'Pff, ja dat is waar.'
'Maar ik wil iets gaan drinken 😭'
'Nee dat is waar'
'Maar dat is ook niet erg. Kwaliteit over kwantiteit eh 😉'
'Ah ja, dat verklaard al wel wat meer 😁'
'En ik ga naar Berlaar, daar iets drinken &colon;&rpar;'
'Daar is minder volk'
'Ja het is wel al serieus afgekoeld'
'Ben nu ook onderweg naar huis'
'Daar is een groot terras dus daarmee 😁'
'Kangoeroe of krokodil steak is ook goed'
'Ze maken die stukken veel te smal en dan kan je die niet goed bakken. Echt jammer'
'Ik voornamelijk koude kant gestaan maar in de servies hielp ik ook wel warme kant maar nu niet dat ik alles maakten dus zo goed kan ik nu ook weer niet koken. Vooral slaatjes haha 😁'
'En wat is dan wel uw doelberoep?'
'En jaaa, dat vind ik lief! ☺️'

'Oké, dus nu moet er enkel nog beslist worden om hoe laat?'
'Kies maar hehe'
'Enkel van sommige dieren haha'
'Slaapwel!!'
'Ja ik ook😁'
'Niet dat ik dat nodig heb hoor 😉 Maar het is wel goed dat mijn eerste indruk dus not niet helemaal naar de boem is 😁'
'Ook in u?'
'Daar kan ik nog met leven'
'Alleja ne goeie wel, maar ne grote niet haha'
'Ja maar dat is riskant'
'Ken je die serie ‘the 100&rsquo; van op Netflix?'
'Aaaah, daar kom ik wel al eens in het weekend 😃'
'Ik ga daar soms uit 😄'
'Ja, ik amuseer mij daar wel 😃'
'Ik ook 😁'
'Eeuwige dankbaarheid in ruil'
'Hahaha was dit al vergeten 😄'
'Is dat ook 3 jaar? 😁'
'En eeeikes, stage'
'Ik doe dat niet graag haha'
'Ik ga na dit jaar ook nog eens drie jaar doen haha 😁'
'En ja ik werk niet graag gratis haha'
'Alle maar verpleegster? Dat vind ik wel sexy 😉'

'En nee die moeten spontaan komen haha'
'Ja snap ik wel 😃'
'Waarom doe je dat nual niet?'
'Dat deel ik wel niet graag haha'
'Koningshooikt'
'Ik leer beter op zelfstudie'
'En ik heb sowieso deze week nog geen les eh 😁'

'En kom naar NRG in lier,  als ik iemand rekruteer krijg ik een nieuwe sportzak haha'
'Auto van thuis gekregen? Goed verwent ofwa ? 😛'
'Oei, klinkt niet goed.'
'Oeps'
'Ik wil een paar suggesties doen'
'ik moet volgende week ook wel terug opstaan 😔'
'We nemen die gele taxi&rsquo;s eh'
'Enkel met happy ending eh 🙃'
'Ja nee ik kan niet dansen maar ik vind dat wel super leuk'
'Ja dat ken ik maar al te goed'
'Heel graag maar ik ga volgend jaar naar Leuven'
'Kom mee naar Leuven'
'Dat is veel leuker haha'
'Ja maar ik was ook 6maand gestopt maar dan was ik terug begonnen dus nu probeer ik het op een andere manier'
'Maar ik ‘vape&rsquo; btw wel'
'Iets met dieren die ineens agressief worden haha'

'Is beide ook een optie? 😉'
'Is uwe pot wel groot genoeg?'
'Ja dat was dus ook niet de bedoeling'
'En wat versta ge onder vaag?'
'Dus dan ben je per definitie niet vaag'
'Mysterieus akkoord, onbekend en ongedefinieerd kan in twijfel trekken'
'Verklaart u vaagheid wel hahaha'
'Is de  &apos;wie niet waagt, niet wint-regel&apos; niet meer van toepassing? 😁'

'Waarom heb ik zo&apos;n gevoel dat je totaal niet de persoon bent van u foto&apos;s?🤔'
'Ik geloof in je'
'Kan niet volgen haha'
'Oei oei, ben ik nu afgekeurd?😁'
'Nog iets waar ge u door aangetrokken voelt?'

'Koningshooikt'
'dat is iets van een serie dat ik volg &colon;&rpar;'

'Dus wat voor mij een saai bord gekookte aardappelen met groenten is is voor jou nasi goreng'
'Nou, kom maar op met je 36 vragen'
'Oke'
'Wat voor plek woon je? Met wie?'
'Dat snapte ik'
'Maar wat voor soort iets is het'
'Ik heb vandaag een luie dag'
'Als er een leuke klik is wel ja!'
'Hoe lang geleden was die? Hoe lang, en waarom eindigde hij?'
'Dat laatste doe ik ook. Conversion rate optimization. '
'Of in ieder geval, ik probeer niet de waardering te verhogen maar de winst'
'Dat zeg ik als iemand die in totaal zo&apos;n jaar in Colombia is geweest'
'Maar als man heb je ook meer calorieën nodig'
'Sounds like a keeper '
'Dus dan ben ik nu niet wat je zoekt'
'Maar je bent mooi in je foto&apos;s. Al kan ik me voorstellen dat die foto van je borsten vooral mannen aantrekt die kortetermijn seks willen. 😃'
'Hoe dom ben ik dat ik op de play knop klikte in je profiel?'
'Meer boob dan karakter. Leg uit'
'Is dat dan irl of ook al op Tinder?'
'I was working'
'I see'
'5 would be better'
'Makes sense!'
'Digo'
'En verdad?'
'Mooie timing'
'Ja dit is ook niet bepaald met mensen die ik niet ken'
'Was het leuk?'
'Welke drugs?'
'Mag, van wie?'
'We willen weer naar into the woods'
'Ken je die?'
'Gewoon doen! Bij de Jellinek kliniek. Donderdagavond. Doe ik ook 😀'
'Marloes'
'Zo lang niet gedaan'
'Pardon. Diepe gesprekken hier'
'Volgende vraag!'
'Ik heb heuse dates gehad via Tinder '
'Wat erg. Ik was gewoon een week niet op Tinder ofzo'
'Hoewel ik het niet weer zou doen als ik die kans kreeg'
'Very good!'
'Nooo'
'Ok'
'Wonderful view'
'Good night!'
'Liked it!'
'I send you love sweetie'
'A week '
'You look good yourself '
'Like DTF? 😊 '
'I&apos;m going to sleep 🙊'
'5 nights in Sg'
'You like men like that?'
'I wonder how you would view me'
'Did you manage to hook up?'
'So sweet!'
'Nooo'
'You look gorgeous '
'Nooo'
'Ecstasy is wonderful'
'Ontspannen, wandelen in mooie natuur. '
'En soms meer naar binnen, nadenken '
'Maar wel ontzettend boeiend '
'Maar die feestjes waren er niet?'
'En waar woon je anders?'
'Waar ben je nieuwsgierig naar?'
'Nee. Meestal mid of begin 20'
'Hoe is jouw dating verleden? Relaties? Losse dates? Wilde seks orgies?'
'Gedate mag ook wel denk ik'
'Je eerste relatie ooit dit jaar?'
'Ik durf niks te zeggen want straks ga je me blokken!'
'Wat doe je voor werk dan?'
'Welke studie deed je?'
'Wat zijn je grootste hobby&apos;s&sol;interesses&sol;passies?'
'Daar woon ik nu wel ja'
'Hoe ken je Wout? En sinds wanneer?'
'Maar werk verder!'
'Voorbeeld van tunnelvisie?'
'Ik drink de teleurstelling nu weg met pure vodka'
'Oké kom maar op!'
'Wat vind je nep aan dit gesprek?'
'Dan heb je heel weinig inspiratie. Je weet nog niks van me'
'Wat maakte de ene saai?'
'Ik heb wel wat dates gehad van Tinder. Stuk of 3-4 ofzo. Sommige gingen beter dan andere, maar heb nog contact met sommige.'
'De andere site waarvoor ik werk is ook heel cool'
'Maar om verder te gaan, ik wil nu vooral genieten van het nu en van de kansen die ik heb'
'Daar moet ik gebruik van maken '
'Maar nu moet ik slapen!'
'Wat doe jíj wakker?'
'Afgerond'
'Maar wat dan wat?'
'Dan ben ik goed gekwalificeerd'
'Maar sommige dingen interesseren me eindeloos'
'Maar leuk 😀'
'Nou, dat vind ik juist een van die boeiende onderwerpen'
'En hoe en waar?'
'Alle mensen denken aan seks.'
'Maar sommige doen dat op een gare manier, en andere niet'
'Slaap lekker!'
'Sorry dat ik niet reageerde meer! Ik besefte me dat ik nog even niet kan daten. Maar ik ben niet zo dat ik ga negeren '
'Had je nog anderen gedate toen je vader weg was?'
'Waarom niet?'
'Hoe ging dat?'
'Hoe oud was die tweede?'
'Nee ik ga voorlopig niet daten'
'Doei'
'Hey Jitske!'
'Uit of gewoon ook nog wakker?'
'Van al die mooie dingen, welke vind je het mooiste'
'Maar ik werk veel en hard hoor'
'En dan wat?'
'Ok! Entiendo!'
'Ik heb Tinder omdat ik nieuwsgierig was.'
'Dat laatste is wel waar ja...'
'Heb ik ook al gehoord ja'
'&lpar;Wat vraag ik dat weer soepel he&rpar;'
'Nog niemand ontmoet'
'Ik bedoelde kieskeurig met streng '
'&lpar;Jaja, die studie was niet voor niks&rpar;'
'Nu ben ik wel nieuwsgierig'
'Die ene met 21 eronder?'
'Is die van afgelopen sinterklaas?'
'&lpar;Die mening was wel positief hoor. Maar ik slikte hem in omdat ik soms veel te eerlijk ben&rpar;'
'Ik nu ook, langzame reageerder'
'Kan jij lekker knuffelen? Of hou je daar niet van?'
'Slaap lekker'
'Beste knuffelaar ooit 8&rpar;'
'Maar anders kan je dus dartster worden'
'Oh. Ik weet niet wat HRM is dus vandaar'
'*bloos*'
'Wat leer je op je studie?'
'Anders printen we die uit en plakken we die op ons voorhoofd op de date'
'&lpar;Of is dit soms een strategie om mannen over te houden die niet per se seks willen&rpar;'
'Mag ik nog wel dingen vragen? &colon;&rpar;'
'Hoeveel relaties heb je tot nu toe gehad?'
'Waar woonde die Franse??'
'Maar dat is niet waar'
'Voor sommige dingen moet ik dingen vragen'
'Ik ben niet goed in dingen kort houden'
'Oké dat is beter'
'En die was zeker kut'
'Als ik van een ding niet houd is het oppervlakkige seks'
'Oké. Ik ga je later vragen hoe je emoties niet serieus werden genomen en daar ga je op antwoorden. Jawel'
'Vooruit'
'Vind je sommige dingen leuk om te doen?'
'Ik hoor liever de minder saaie, spannendere en vreemdere feitjes ;&rpar;'
'Want met dit tempo komt dit gesprek rond 2015 op gang!'
'Maar daar kom je vast niet vandaan!'
'Klinkt alsnog slim. Ik weet veel van veel dingen, maar niet van politiek '
'Nog nooit. Maar gaat wel gebeuren '
'Wat is de reden dat je nog nooit hebt afgesproken? '
'Dat is ook leuk!'
'Ik zou hoogstens lekker willen knuffelen!'
'Je bent ook maar 25 km van hier, dat is niet ver!'
'Maar als ik die info geef dan klopt het niet &lpar;a&rpar;'
'Haha, ik wou dat ik die vaardigheid had'
'Dat werkt ook beter met dat ik nog wil reizen '
'En ja ik neem de leiding wel. 8&rpar;'
'Daarom wil ik ook terug '
'Gelukkig nieuwjaar &colon;&rpar;'
'Nou, een naaktfoto zou ik willen omdat ik geniet van de spanning en opwinding die we dan allebei voelen en omdat ik dan geniet van de foto'
'Niet op foto&apos;s in dit geval'
'Dat vind ik goed'
'Oke'
'Je positiviteit is weer indrukwekkend. &colon;p'
'Ja we vonden elkaar onaardig doen!'
'Maar dit is theorie uit je leerboeken?'
'Hoeft ook niet'
'Wees positief! Wees positief! Jaaaaaa, goedzo meisje! =&rpar; \n&lpar;Als je een huisdier was&rpar;'
'Jaloers!'
'Is alles goed gegaan?'
'0630713514 op whatsapp. Kom maar op'
'Waar kom je vandaan Anouck?'
'Wat vet, wat deed je in Amerika?'
'Ik studeer nu niet meer. Ik werk '
'Nu spreek je dus vloeiend Engels'
'Huidtherapie, daar wil je ook in gaan werken?'
'Dan ben ik benieuwd hoe vaak je wordt terug geliked'
'Was je behoefte voor sensatie alweer vervuld? ;&rpar;'
'Haha, niet als we dat niet willen '
'Dat is wel luxe'
'Met zo&apos;n tekst onder je foto moest ik je wel liken'
'Dus per ongeluk geliked?'
'Ja. Drama. Ik heb hier al twee vazen stukgegooid '
'Ook fitness, en ik hou van reizen, en leuke nieuwe dingen leren '
'Maar dan wens ik je succes '
'Lekker getraind? '
'Maar heb je niet meer foto&apos;s? '
'Februari weg'
'Maar laten we het gesprek niet standaard houden '
'Dus 3 dingen'
'Haha die rare ervaring..'
'Maar dat was niet per se de stoutste of geilste, maar wel de lekkerste'
'Haha leuk eerste gesprek hadden we'
'Welke studie?'
'Dat geloof ik'
'Ben afgestudeerd, master sport en prestatiepsychologie  gedaan'
'Ja is net nieuwe master'
'Ja min of meer. &colon;&rpar; Maar ik werk nu meer met websites ontwikkelen en optimaliseren dan psychologie!'
'Is grappig gelopen'
'Ik heb genoeg &lpar;nouja, nog niet genoeg&rpar; gereisd. Je kan me vragen'
'Australië, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodja, Maleisië, Myanmar, India &lpar;vakantie paar keer&rpar;, Colombia, Ecuador '
'Dat klinkt geweldig &colon;&rpar;'
'Nog niet dat ik weet'
'Zou je die van ons willen plakken?'
'Oké, raarste plek..'
'Nog een vraag. Oke.'
'Staat ie er niet tussen?'
'Voor nu, slaap lekker en niet te veel denken!'
'Van hoe laat tot hoe laat was dat?'
'Tot 5 uur s middags?'
'Wat nog meer?'
'Ohh ik vroeg toen hoe je jaarwisseling was &colon;P'
'Maar ik ben geloof ik nooit binnen geweest'
'Maar alles is goed gekomen dus no worries &colon;&rpar;'
'Niet heel slim. Maak ik geen gewoonte van'
'Dat is ook oké.'
'Is dat ook uit pure verstandigheid, of op dat gebied wel genaaid?'
'Nou, in Colombia werd ik ook verliefd. Ook vaak ruzie. Drama om niks. Ik kon haar niet verlaten. Want ik was verliefd, wat ik nooit ben.\nAchteraf zie ik in dat ik me liet gebruiken omdat ik niet weg kon kopen. Dat gaf haar de macht om alles te maken. Er waren toch geen consequenties '
'Die wil je niet!'
'Of verder. Dan kan je meegroeien'
'&lpar;Niet dat ik de term niet ken, maar ik wil jouw definitie&rpar;'
'Bedoel je aangetrokken als in verliefd of seksuele aantrekkingskracht?'
'Dat kan ook onbewust gebeuren.'
'Slaap lekker voor nu. &colon;&rpar;'
'Wel goed gekomen?'
'Soms gelooft iemand ook niet dat ie beter verdient'
'Je haat gaat diep'
'Definieer &apos;te lief&apos;?'
'Dat ben ik ontgroeid '
'Ik beloof dat ik blijf'
'Zo ben ik ook. Wat niet mag is lekkerder'
'Hoe oud waren jullie?'
'Ja. Vooral de meest ordinaire vrouwen. Die handelen puur uit onzekerheid '
'Maar wat deed die klootzak?'
'Ik ook nog nooit. '
'Of huis'
'Is goed. Slaap lekker'
'En gaat dat goed?'
'Ja is ook leuk!'
'Maar ik ben er nog niet lang mee bezig. '
'Ja oké. Als ik een date voorstel die  &apos;heel erg leuk&apos; is dan stel ik me ook wat wederzijdse aantrekkingskracht voor. Maar die ontbrak dus'
'Ik heb nog niet gedate van Tinder.'
'Je woont op 1 kilometer afstand. Benieuwd waar dan &colon;&rpar;'
'Maar ik ben nu aan 5 boeken begonnen die ik nog moet uitlezen '
'Dat is pittig!'
'Maar nieuwe mensen ontmoeten is ook leuk'
'Dat klopt'
'Waar werk je?'
'Nou dat weet je nog niet!'
'Nog nooit gedaan?'
'Dat is akelig.. Sorry, dat wist ik niet'
'Leuke jaarwisseling gehad?'
'Hoe laat kwam je in huis?'
'En hoe voel je je verder, na die nare gebeurtenis met kerst?'
'Oja dat is waar! De kokkin &colon;&rpar;'
'Ik bleef nog slapen toen in hun huis'
'En wat gedaan daar?'
'Staat nog niet vast'
'Nu mag ik weer vragen stellen'
'Pff niet de meest boeiende dag ooit vandaag!'
'Ik weet nog wel hoe de date ging'
'Afgestudeerd, maar nu werk ik nog steeds voor die man van de stage &colon;&rpar;'
'Waar ik wil. Is via de laptop '
'Nog interessante ontwikkelingen in je leven sindsdien?'
'Maar nog wel gereisd 4 maandjes in Azië dit jaar en ik wil binnenkort weer weg, naar Zuid-Amerika. Dus ik mag niet klagen'
'Was ik de enige met wie je had afgesproken via online dating?'
'Maar er komen zulke lekkere meiden langs af en toe. Dan maar oppervlakkig, maar dan wil ik die in mijn bed &colon;$'
'Daarom wil ik óók weer terug naar Colombia'
'Zoals jou heb ik er weinig gedate. '
'Ongesteld was je'
'Vonk, als in verliefd, of seksuele aantrekkingskracht?'
'Bindingsangst kan dat ook blokkeren denk ik &colon;p'
'Ik ben totaal niet jaloers'
'Maar wie weet wat ik denk als ik echt verliefd word weer'
'Maar goed. Voor nu ben ik lekker open minded'
'Tu work où?'

'Is jouw broertje diegene op de voorgrond? In die rap video op je insta?'
'Verstandig wel'
'Dat was al de tweede keer!'
'Weekend!!'
'Snap kan wel!'
'Maar dan gaan we wel kletsen met foto&apos;s hoor😁'
'Maar ik leer ook mensen graag kennen, echt kennen. Diepgang is daar wel voor nodig..'
'Ik weet ook niet of ik flirten via de app wel genoeg vind'
'Heb ik! Doe er nog even niks mee, maar heb het wel 😏'
'En ik ben heel benieuwd waar ik de super like aan verdiend heb 😳 Je bent de eerste &lpar;leuke&rpar; die ik krijg. I feel so special right now🥰'
'Dus dat werkt niet samen'
'Maar ja is goed! Leuk!\nIk ben ook best handig, dus als je nog wat hulp nodig hebt met klussen! 😄'
'Sure ik help graag!'
'Ja ik heb een relatie van drie jaar gehad.'
'Heb je toffe weekend plannen met dit geweldige weer?'
'Dat is ook okay 😊'
'Ja dat is goed!'
'Ik ook. Zeker!'
'Nee, wat doe je echt? Als beroep of studie of of'
'Die van jou is korter samengevat. 🤓'
'Maar heel tof die reis!!'
'Anyways..\nInteressant Toner gesprek 😜'
'Sorry is nergens voor nodig. Alleen maar leuk toch'
'Hoe kan je nou niet van roze koeken houden!'
'Pastei ben ik ook geen fan van.'
'Nou dat snap ik wel 😳'
'Stiekem.'
'No worries ☺️'
'Wat is de lokale omroep hier, van de NOS?'
'Dan beantwoord ik ook dan je andere vraag wel'
'Slaap lekker 😚'
'Vroeger kon ik wel middag dutjes doen'
'Oh kut wakker geworden?'
'Met de wekker?'
'Altijd kut als die wekker gaat in je diepe slaap..'
'Nee dat snap ik wel'
'Hoe ging die?'
'Ging vlekkeloos?'
'Dat stukje snap ik nog niet'
'Ik snap je, no worries 😊'
'Vergeet je sportkleding niet mee te nemen naar je werk vandaag 😁'
'Maar je bied ook aan iemand te koppelen aan je vriendinnen?'
'Oops!'
'Beetje druk gehad 🕺'
'Oh oh oh. En ik houd niet van slapen. Behalve als ik met iemand slaap, maar anders doe ik liever andere dingen'
'Volgende week heb ik best nog wat open plekjes.\nWerkt ze fulltime?'
'Geweldig nieuws!'
'Zaterdagmiddag heb ik om 1500 een half uur meeting. Ik kan die wat later proberen te plannen.'
'Tof! Ik kom dan vanaf de Pathé kant af'
'Nooooo'
'Doordeweeks een optie?'
'De 15e kan ik ook wel! ☺️'
'Ik ga even wat leuks opzoeken. Standstrand is zo standaard hè, maar aan het water is leuk.'
'Ik ga straks naar de IKEA! Uitje van het jaar'
'Ja die aan de Deventerstraat is erg prettig! Die ga ik als eerste opzoeken denk ik.'
'Stiekem wil ik wel graag wat meer plantjes hebben'
'Is al bekend wanneer die weg gaat?'
'Maar ja! Laten we dat doen!\nNeutrale plek dan ook? Terrasje? Wandelen?'
'Ja dat klinkt als win-win-win!'
'Is donderdag niet een vrije dag, sowieso? Ik volg al die vrije dagen niet zo. Maar die is het makkelijkst. Anders kan ik maandag tot 8 uur of woensdag vanaf 5 uur.'
'Ik weet niet zo goed of ik daar nou serieus op in moet gaan of niet 😆'
'En hoe bewaak ik dat? Niet per se. Ik plan alle leuke dingen van te voren in en alle left over time is voor werk 😅'
'Op je bek gegaan? Hoe, wat, waarom?'
'Spotnaam vrienden voor de deur is me nog nooit overkomen 😅'
'Nee dat is zo&apos;n 2 minuten wandelen van Boreas, dus komt goed! ☺️'
'Ik ben trouwens ook boos.'
'Oké gelukkig maar.. Ik was juist diegene die het minste met SpongeBob had😅'
'Ja klopt. Heel leuk verdien model 😊'
'Ja dat snap ik heel goed 😋'
'Hoe was de jouwe? 😊'
'Enne, ook hoi. Ja ik ben weer terug 🙄'
'Verder zoek ik graag uitdagingen op en leer ik graag nieuwe dingen! Dus als je iets leuks weet wat ik nog nooit gedaan heb, dan sta ik er altijd voor open'
'Dus..... Had je lekker gewerkt?'
'Apothekersassistente. Is dat iets anders dan apotheker? Of apotheekmedewerker? '
'Nee ik vind &apos;m leuk!'
'En Fitness? Hoe los je dat nu op?'
'Koop ik een thermofles en neem ik koffie of thee mee'
'Weekend of doordeweeks'
'Weekend daarna dan?😄'
'Helemaal komende dagen nog niet.'
'Die trap, trouwens.'
'Ja ik vind &apos;m wel heel leuk, hahaha'
'Nou dat is niet niks!'
'Koop of huur dan?'
'Dus ik ga nu eerst gewoon weer wat vermogen opbouwen'
'Ja serieus'
'Dus vandaar woon ik wat verder weg 💁'
'Nou ja dat weet ik nog niet helemaal..'
'Maaike ik heb een vraag.'
'Nee stiekem snap ik het nog steeds niet, haha'
'Maak je vooral niet weer boos om dat hele geval'
'Dat eerste, dat probleem heb ik ook.'
'Maar om nou elke dag groot uit te pakken als je voor jezelf kookt....'
'Nu snap ik er niks meer van 😭'
'Autovakanties? Wat is dan het verste land waar je geweest bent?'
'Wat is niet vaak?'
'Zelf ook je dus niet vlees, maar niet erg om te eten? Vind ik wel top van je!'
'Wanneer kom ik langs dan?'
'Maar die kan ik niet beantwoorden'
'Als het nou nog 3x gebeurt dan zou ik me wel gekwetst voelen.'
'Vis is ook lekker... En flink gezond ook'
'Ik eet heel graag rijst. Nasi goreng boordevol groenten. Pasta&apos;s vind ik ook erg lekker, maar wel met rode saus.'
'Ik word gewoon graag als een prins behandeld 🤴'
'Al kan ik voor een leuk persoon wel goed moeite doen.'
'Ik had een super druk weekend.'
'Hele drukke week uberhaupt.'
'Even volle dagen. Veel werk, deadlines, maar gelukkig ook wel gevuld met leuke dingen ☺️'
'Helemaal niks gedaan het hele weekend lang?'
'Nu wel een drukke week voor de boeg?'
'Die heb ik al jaren niet meer gesproken ondertussen. En nu dus nog steeds niet'
'Ik ben opgegroeid in Apeldoorn'
'Is dat een betere kennismaking? 😄'
'Ik ben wel benieuwd naar je kookkunsten. Ik doe de afwas. Wanneer?'
'Maar die dinsdag kan ik eigenlijk ook wel! Als dat beter is?'
'Kom je hier langs? Stukje nieuws... Ik woon sinds kort weer op kamers, dus dan hebben we last van huisgenoten.'
'Ooh noo'
'No worries. Kletsen we gewoon over een paar weken weer verder ☺️'
'Of als je afleiding nodig hebt dan roep je maar!'
'Gewoon even weekend nodig?'
'Maar wel tof hè!!'
'Neee nee nee'
'Is je vader of moeder Marokkaans?🤓'
'Maar ook hier is verder alles goed hoor 🤓'
'Of krijg je naar jou toe geworpen?'
'Dus wat nu....'
'Sorry, hoe kan ik het goedmaken'
'Alcohol is leuk, maar simpel.'
'Verder heb ik geen idee wat je leuk vind?'
'Maar wie legt nou €600 neer voor een huisdiertje'
'Happy ending breng ik extra kosten voor in rekening'
'Is alles nu weer goed tussen ons dan? ❤️'
'Gelukkig maar.'
'Nu snel vroem vroem 🏎️'
'En ik schrik niet! Ik ben nog steeds groter😄'
'Dan stem ik voor Whatsapp!'
'I knew it! Super likes do work!!'
'Beter een fikse Ferrari met gebruikssporen dan een nieuwe Twingo, right?'
'Mooi gesproken!'
'Dankjewel!'
'Ik heb ook maar gewoon wat random emojis tussen de text gegooid hoor, haha'
'Dat is positief 😏😜'
'Lastig... Vervelend wel, maar mooie 10 maanden gehad?'
'Ik heb twee huisgenoten. Waaronder één die nu haar tweede week op kamers woont. Dat is me ook wat hoor..'
'Maar nu met werk wel dus, heel random!'
'Maareuh.. Wanneer krijg ik Spaans les van je?'
'Nee dat wist ik nog niet. Is dat zo?'
'Niet voor niks waarom ik vraag wanneer ik lessen van je krijg'
'Ik wil heel graag weer eens lekker stappen ook'
'Maar toen verhuisde ik naar Kampen.'
'En tussendoor dus twee jaartjes weg geweest maar Kampen'
'Is koud daar! Of is dat juist ook een van de dingen die je trekt?'
'Alles geloof ik. Ik ben wel benieuwd naar de werkcultuur?'
'Ja samen dansen! Dat vind ik leuk!'
'Dansen is ook iets doen'
'Maaarrr ik ga voor Engelse werk!'
'Dus dan kan je jouw kleren nog uittrekken.'
'Of nouja. 2 normale ook goed?'
'Sweet dreams'
'Ja ik voel m ook'
'Okay. Dan doe ik rustig aan 🤭'
'Okay beginnen simpel hè.'
'Maar, goed antwoord wel!'
'Wil je doorvragen of mag ik alweer? 🤭'
'Jaa heel nieuwsgierig'
'Ja fuck. Daar had ik me niet op voorbereid'
'Snel gedaan ook'
'En daarna. Tja, nee. Nog steeds niet..'
'Ja had paniek ik wist het niet meer, haha'
'Ik snap je supermarkt vraag niet 😳'
'Dus daar ergens tussenin denk ik'
'Ja dat denk ik ook'
'Vooral badderen ook 😍'
'Nou dat is goed!'
'Zou het daarna ook weer beter weer worden?'
'Volgepland ben ik wel'
'Maar ik moet wel plannen want anders vergeet ik ALLES'
'Dus ik heb wel een leuk weekend!'
'Ik verveel me nooit 🙈'
'Dus dat vertel ik later even, ok?☺️'
'Nee no worries!'
'Ik wil wel alles typen, maar hey. Waarom niet gewoon afspreken?'
'Dinsdag!'
'Morgen kan ik helaas niet'
'Dinsdag lunch wandeling kan wel!!'
'Of kan eerder ook?'
'Ja ben ik ook geweest!'
'Dat is ook waar ik in de jungle geslapen heb'
'Kamperen! Wauw dat heb ik lang niet meer gedaan!'
'Lekker Nederlands. Houd ik wel van!'
'Zeker! Die eerste maar één keer. Die vond ik ook eigenlijk leuker, maar die kan ik niet meer terug vinden'
'Rare Vietnamese tekens.'
'Ja tof gewoon he!'
'En je kan er nog wat van leren ook'
'Maar dat klinkt tof!'
'Weet niet zeker of ik in slaap ben gevallen ook..'
'Hoeveel ook alweer?'
'Weet niet hoeveel details ik je kant op kan gooien over het werk wat ik doe..'
'JEZUS\nverliefd'
'Als in, komende 2 a 3 weken?'
'Ik zit komende week al wel een beetje vol. Zaterdag begin van de middag heb ik nog niks.\nAnders weekje later ook okay ☺️'
'Enne.. misschien moet ik ook nog even wat flexibele kleding halen dan 😅'
'Ja dan doe ik alsof ik een afspraak ben vergeten en snel weg moet'
'Korte sportbroek ok?'
'Ik lul er maar gewoon overheen en ga terug naar datum prikken'
'Later die dag heb ik avondje met een vriend die ik al sinds groep 3 ken. Vind ik wel een belangrijke afspraak, maar die zie ik pas eind vd middag ☺️'
'Welk dorpje ben je opgegroeid?'
'Ik ben opgegroeid in Apeldoorn'
'Dat is niet veel nee.. gemiddeld 8 kinderen per jaar ofzo?'
'Ook nog'
'Dat is niet één kilometer ☹️'
'Nou ik was niet zo stoer hoor'
'Kan je nu wel slapen met die spanning?'
'Werken overdag. Alleen wat ik precies ga werken weet ik nog niet.'
'Jawel, gewoon 2100 thuis.'
'Al langs geweest?'
'Dan kan ik ook lekker naar bedje, hihi'
'Mooie dromen'
'Ooh dat is minder..'
'Oom? Nou ja ik ben drie jaar ouder dan de oudste.'
'Jaa klopt.\nVan baby helemaal tot nu jonge vrouw'
'Hoe laat ga je op kraamvisite?'
'Dat is nu!!!!'
'Ook door de relatie die ik had.'
'Groeit als kool hoor!'
'Stiekem snap ik dat wel'
'Dit is niet erg truth or dare, maar wat achtergrond informatie is ook wel leuk om te weten'
'Ja vind ik ook! ☺️'
'Jaa ik snap dat waarom ook wel'
'Ik ben nog lekker aan de slag, nu ook nog even doorpakken tot ik zo ga koken'
'En dan vertel ik straks wat uitgebreider wat ik doe'
'Nieuwsgierigheid is groot, maar ik hoor nog geen ja?\nNiet te hoge hopen nu hoor'
'Merkte dat ik er wel wat hulp bij kon gebruiken'
'Hangt er wel vanaf aan wie je hulp vraagt..'
'Sweet dreams 😊😊'
'Of dinsdagmiddag en dan verschuif ik die meeting gewoon wat'
'Kan je de hele middag of heb je nog wel andere dingen&sol;afspraken?\nEn hoe lang kan je, wat laat je werk toe?'
'Wellicht wat lang? Kan ook nog wel wat werktijd gebruiken.'
'Half 4 tot half 6 dus, dinsdag?'
'Ja laten we dat wel gewoon doen.'
'jawel jawel. ik kan zaterdag wel'
'Heb gelukkig wel een plek om me terug te trekken!'
'Dansen'
'Maar nu weer terug.'
'Ja die staat sowieso!'
'Maar s middags ben je aan het werk dus dat is ook net ...'
'Dat klinkt wel ingewikkeld'
'Precies die ene dag dat ik echt niet kan ☹️'
'Dat van oppas regelen dat snapte ik ☺️☺️'
'Zullen we dan die dinsdag of woensdag doen?'
'Oh ook ideaal!'
'☹️☹️ ik krijg dit door'
'Wel wat verder weg inderdaad'
'Alleen avond of s middags kan ook al?'
'Zooo ik heb lang geslapen'
'Was moe!'
'Volgens mij wist ik dat nog niet 🤭'
'Ik kreeg ook nog een zusje toen ik al 16 was. Dus dat was ook wel weer interessant 🤭'
'Kan je daar iets mee?'
'Dus... Wat is je favoriete milkshake smaak?'
'Was er niet specifiek naar opzoek hoor'
'Okay beginnen simpel.\nWat is je aller grootste allergie? Waar kan je echt boos van worden?'
'Ik kan heel veel zeggen en of vragen. Je hebt super leuke foto&apos;s. Maar bovenal vraag ik me vooral af wat dat groene&sol;witte ding op je hoofd is op die foto van onderen'
'Wel jammer dat ik vervolgens pas laat reageer.'
'Och ik heb me vandaag toch wat geweldigs gedaan...'
'Maar ik ga dit zeker vaker doen.. 😁'
'Wist ik ook niet. Probeerde gewoon Tinder te googlen en dat werkte!'
'Maar op de mobiel werkt ook weer gelukkig.'
'Qua foto&apos;s, ja klopt! Onder andere van wereldreis & bruiloft van twee Maleisische vrienden die ik heb overgehouden aan die wereldreis 😊'
'Ja ja daar ben ik weer 😁'

'Maar goed dat ik die niet direct gestuurd heb? 😅'
'Zie dat je ook niet om de hoek woont'
'Maar eerst... Wat vind je nog meer leuk dan kip eten in het weekend?'
'Heb wel meer mensen gehoord over dat nieuwe Twilight boek. And I don&apos;t judge, no worries.'
'Ooohh Super Natural. Ik heb daar de eerste drie afleveringen van gekeken, but it didn&apos;t hook me.. '
'Star wars heb ik dan nooit gekeken nee. Star Gate dan wel weer, dat is nog betern.'
'Romantiek! Zal ik wat kaarsjes meenemen?'

'Maar we kunnen er ook wel de diepte op in gaan'
'Goeiesmiddags Debbie'
'Online shoppen als eerste date is super raar. I like it.'
'Ik kan ook wel wat nieuwe kleding gebruiken.'
'Haha, nee dat is ook zeker waar!'
'Kon er ook al niks van maken adhv je foto&apos;s. Elke keer van alles'
'Ik word ook nooit volwassen.'
'Oh, haha.\nJa nog niet. Maar dat gaat nog wel een keer gebeuren'
'Curaçao mooi om te duiken?\nIk wil nog wel naar Bonaire'
'Welk volgende duikoord staat op de planning?'

'Hoe lang is dat geleden'
'Hahaha Ja die kans zit er dik in 😂'
'Kroeg dansen 😅'
'Lekker zeg! Slaapkop😋'
'Hoe kan dat dan? Zwaar weekend gehad waar je nog van in moet halen?'
'Gebeurt dat niet vaak? Ben je wel eens voor de wekker wakker?'
'Ooh. Werd je gewekt in je diepe slaap?'
'Ikke, haha. Jou ken ik nog niet zo goed'
'Maar dat is wel goed nieuws!'
'Niet vies.'
'Mooie haartjes. &lpar;elke dag wassen hoeft dan weer net niet&rpar;'

'Zondag mag ik weer vroeg slapen'
'Gelukkig wel 😊'
'Qua opgroeien, Apeldoorn'
'Nou nee niet perse, maar ook absoluut niet leuk &sol;goed'

'Jammer dat je weg bent gegaan!\nIk denk dat ik tot 3 jaar terug regelmatig in het paard kwam, ook op de donderdag.\nMaar toen moest ik opeens elke vrijdag heel serieus naar stage.\nMaar dat zou dus wel goed kunnen\n\nIk heb er ook gewerkt. Vanaf 6 jaar terug tot 3 jaar terug ongeveer'

'En ja, dat is goed 😋'
'Dat betekend dat ook niet direct'
'Kattenfeestje geloof ik dat het was?'
'Maar ondertussen is het alweer woensdag! 😅'

'Mooi weekend vol met feestjes dus!'
'Okee gelukkig maar dan 🙈'
'Nee dat geloof ik wel 🙈'

'Ah leuk! Naar welke film ben je gegaan?'
'Ik heb ook pas sinds 2 weken Netflix 😇'
'Antwoord dat maar niet😇'
'Jong wel, om zo&apos;n lange relatie te hebben!'

'Haha, eten ja lekker!\nMaar van wie is dat geen hobby?\n...\nOké niet iedereen.. 🙈\nWat eet je graag?'
'Ja. Dat hoofdstuk is afgesloten &colon;&rpar;'
'Precies wat heb je daar gedaan?'

'September 2016.\nAnderhalf jaar.'
'Ja is heel wat!'
'Ik heb ook hele rare dromen gehad...'
'Weet je wie Jaap Stam is?'
'Welke stad in Cambodja?'

'Volgens onderwerp, ja graag'
'Waar was dat? Dan ga ik gewoon nog een keer die kant op!'
'Oh gelukkig maar'
'Oeh, ja. Dan wil ik meevliegen!'
'Ik wil ook leren surfen!'
'Welke landen ben je nog meer geweest?'
'En dat had ik allemaal van te voren gespaard'
'Ah, ja dat is ook erg tof!'
'Maar dan ga je weer terug naar waar je al geweest bent. Wil je niet nieuwe dingen ontdekken?'
'Ik woon momenteel in Zwolle.\nMaar ik werk en woon 3 dagen op Kasteel Sterkenburg. Dat is in Driebergen'
'Studeer je ook nog dan?'
'Ja goed!\nHoe zit je dinsdag middag?\nIk heb die dag ook weer een online meeting, maar ik kan rond eind van de middag als het goed is wel'
'Werkse vandaag! Tot vanmiddag 😁'
'Oké helemaal goed =&rpar;'
'Goedemorgen Rosan! 🤗'
'Uitbrakken? Haha! Mooie avond gehad?'
'Ja hele mooie ervaring 😊😊'
'Die foto is gemaakt toen ik afgelopen Juni ben terug gegaan, voor een bruiloft 🤗'
'Mag ik nu vragen aan jou stellen? 😜'
'Die hoor je vast niet vaker....\nLaat maar 🙄🙄'
'Goede dag!'
'Hoe was jouw dag?'
'Dus dan kom ik in de buurt =&rpar;'
'Nee. Dat huis verhuur ik 😁'
'Houd ik wel van 😇'
'Spanning heb ik niet per se nodig nee.\nMaar afwisseling vind ik wel prettig. Elke dag het zelfde doen word ik heel erg moe van.\nImpulsief? Ja... 🙈'
'Goedemorgen Britt!\nHekel aan kruimels in de boter... Mag kruimels in bed wel?'
'De fotografie hoek wil je in dus?'
'Woon je in een leuke stad?'
'Weer aan de studie vandaag?'
'En wat houd die afstudeerproductie precies in?'
'Ja ik ook!\nEven 8 uur slapen, en weer door... 😅\nVandaag staat er gelukkig wel iets minder druk op de ketel'
'Ken je kasteel sterkenburg?'
'Oh.\nDat wist ik helemaal niet 🙈🙈'
'Ooh heel gaaf!\nIk wil ook nog heel graag naar beide.\nKomt nog wel 😁'
'Die gebeden die door de hele stad klinken, dat is nog het meest bijzonder'
'Ik ga morgen werken en heb in de middag afgesproken met een vriendin die ik al lang niet meer gesproken heb'
'Maar dat mis ik ook wel..\nIemand om lekker mee te knuffelen'
'En met afspreken hoop ik leuke en interessante gesprekken te bereiken.\nNieuwe interessante mensen ontmoeten &colon;&rpar;'
'Welke was de ergste van de avond vandaag?'
'Gelukkig Nieuwjaar nog hè 😇'
'Verrassend genoeg had ik amper last van een kater..'
'Ah leuk! In de bediening?'
'Is dat dan ook betaald? Of vrijwillig?'
'Ja dat geloof ik heel graag!'
'Niet met je collega&apos;s na het werk nog wat drinken?'
'Werkse! 🤗'
'Dat geloof ik best!'
'Nee dat snap ik wel..'
'Master wel nog, dus anders had je al klaar geweest?'
'Maar niet te, hoor!\nHoop ik?'
'Dat is een stukje langer dan ik ja 😅'
'Ik wil heel graag naar je luisteren..'
'Dat geloof ik wel'
'Maar ik niet, als ik in Doetinchem woon'
'Dat is wel een sterke les.\nIk heb die les gelukkig nooit nodig gehad.'
'Dat geloof ik wel &colon;&rpar;'
'Nee.\nIk heb wel vrienden, maar niet die ik vaak spreek oid.\nEn vrienden van vroeger heb ik niet veel meer. Maar niet omdat ik een relatie kreeg. Dat was meer omdat ik we ver uit elkaar gingen wonen.'
'Nee. Nooit van gehoord!'
'En bumble, wel 2 leuke gesprekken maar meehhh..'
'Happn ja?\nEn waarom is die dan beter Dan Tinder?'
'Ooh wat is die!'
'Dat is die*'
'Ik zoek niet alleen seks. Ik zoek ook leuke gesprekspartners'
'Flexibel!\nIk denk dat ik die middag nog goed kan gebruiken om te werken. Dus laten we de avond doen\nKan jij ook in alle rust uitslapen'
'Nu lekker naar bedje toe. Morgen weer drukke dag'
'Het is prettig dat het kan.\nBetekend wel dat we gewoon nog normaal met elkaar om kunnen gaan'
'Nee dat snap ik heel goed'
'Hoe lang waren jullie ook alweer samen?'
'Oh. Dat is dan wel kut, of niet?..\nIs dat ook waar jullie elkaar ontmoet hebben?'
'Ooh, haha\nMaar dat komt ook wel omdat jullie er niet over spraken denk ik?'
'Mensen dingen leren is leuk!'
'Ja dat geloof ik heel graag'
'Ik heb altijd heel veel moeite met dingen doen die ik niet leuk vind.... 🙈'
'Die ken ik nog niet..'
'Ja die ken ik wel'
'Af en toe zo&apos;n dag. Lekker juist'
'Ook 1 na duurste stad 😇\nEn, ik woon 3 dagen in de week in Driebergen!'
'Ik werk en woon 3 dagen in de week op Kasteel Sterkenburg'
'Wel in net zo&apos;n lekker bed! 😁'
'Nee dat mag je me nu niet besparen'
'Hiphop ja? Ik mag jou wel 😜'
'Aan de studie?'
'Nou saai hoor 😜'
'Nergens voor nodig om te minderen'
'Nee Jaap ken ik niet'
'Daarnaast werk ik voor Kasteel Sterkenburg'

'Maar... Welke films?'
'190. Is dat lang genoeg?'
'En ik ben lid van een roeivereniging 🤐'
'Ooh, Asopos? Leuke vereniging!\nNee zeker geen eeuwig student. Al 2,5 jaar afgestudeerd en volop werkende nu.\nMaar ik heb wel &lpar;nog steeds&rpar; veel vrienden binnen de vereniging, dus ik kom er nog wel eens'

'Doe je vaak dat soort optredens?'
'Gelukkig nieuw jaar Lisanne! Heb je een goede wisseling gehad?'
'Haha, ja dat geloof ik heel graag'
'Zal ik dan maar gewoon? 😜'
'Heb je een mooi weekend gehad? Wat leuks gedaan?'
'Goed voor elkaar!'
'WhatsApp ook goed?'
'Hoe is je weekend?'
'Oh wow dat is goed lang geleden! Waarom kom je hier niet vaker?'
'En, mag ik vragen waar je woont?'
'Hey maar Aimee, ik ben helemaal gesloopt. Ik ga lekker slapen!'
'Hi Adinda!\nNet mag nog 1 dag!\nGelukkig nieuw jaar 😙'
'Heb je een mooie jaarwisseling gehad?'
'YEEEAAHHHHHH!!! Gelukkig nieuw jaar Mylene!!\nHeb je een toffe jaarwisseling gehad?'
'Dat hoop ik wel!'
'Dat is ook lekker! 😊'
'Je bent nu lekker vakantie aan het vieren?'
'Oh, die is gewoon aan Tinder gekoppeld, dat is niet heel diep onderzoek 😇'
'Ja, dan snap ik je terughoudendheid wel'
'Waarom is dat raar?'
'Nu weer terug naar de roots?'
'Hoi Jhossy 🤗\nGelukkig nieuw jaar nog!  begint in ieder geval goed met onze match, niet?'
'Spaans! Gaaf!'
'Dat wil ik stiekem wel leren, denk ik'
'Nou, welkom dan nog! 🤗'

'Wat dan wel?'
'Niet aardige, knuffelende,'
'Dat klinkt al een stuk geloofwaardiger'
'Mooie jaarwisseling gehad?'

'Wat is jouw huidige woonsituatie?'
'Of.. Mag ik dat niet vragen 🙈'
'Maar dat ben ik inderdaad wel ja haha'
'Hyper worden is niks mis mee!'
'Waar ik chagrijnig van kan worden?\nMensen die niet open staan voor nieuwe ideeën'
'Vertel eens over al die mooie foto&apos;s en plekken waar je allemaal geweest bent? 😊'
'En dat van Japan, ja helemaal mee eens. Daar ben ik ook erg benieuwd naar ja'
'Ja dat snap ik ook wel weer ja'
'30 jaar afbetalen is ook niet ideaal..'
'Sowieso leuk om nieuwe mensen te leren kennen 🙈\nDit is één van de manieren'
'Ah, dat vind ik dan wel weer goed van je 😊'
'Ja die heb je er ook tussen..'
'Ja gewoon op straat, haha'
'Nee dit was niet de eerste.\nMaar de vorige keer was ik wel dronken 🙈\nMaar in beide gevallen was niet niet raar nee. Stiekem wel leuk zelfs'
'0627355834\nReageer ik via daar wel weer even op je 😇'
'Gelukkig Nieuwjaar nog!\nHeb je een mooie jaarwisseling gehad?'

'Ja heel leuk..'
'Pff, ook flink ja'
'Dat snap ik heel goed, no worries'
'Hmm, dat is inderdaad jammer. En verstandig van jou'
'Ooh nee'
'Zeker niet'
'Al kan je ook vaak wel veel uit fotos halen geloof ik'
'Als iemand nog geen normaal rekensommetje kan doen...'
'Dag kun je wel stellen'
'Geen gekke dingen verder tegengekomen?'
'Hoe laat staat de wekker?'
'Ooh oké, en die gaat dus nog volgen?'
'Dat snap ik wel als je pas om half 2 gaat slapen'
'En wat een gelukje dat je ex die naam al eens had gehoord!'
'Ook op sexueel gebied neem je ondertussen afstand van je date?'
'Ik ben niet zo goed in oppervlakkige gesprekken. 🙈'
'Ja daarom.. Dan kosten gesprekken meer energie dan dat ze opleveren. Dan ben ik er ook wel snel klaar mee hoor'
'Ja ik swipe nog wel zo nu en dan, maar grotendeels gaat nog steeds naar links'
'Wat is &apos;nog even&apos;?'
'Haha, ja bijna wel he..\nIk vind dit ook leuk om te doen.\nOhja, daar word ik ook gelukkig van. Mensen helpen.'
'Of is dat je vraag niet?'
'Zou ik denken🙈'
'Dat klinkt als goed nieuws?'
'Verstandig'
'Haha, ja dat geloof ik wel'
'En met hoeveel van die 8 was er nog een tweede saté?'
'Ik had vanmiddag wel 3 likes volgens de app. Maar blijkbaar heb ik die naar links gedaan 😅'
'Heb ik alweer naar links gedaan denk ik'
'&lpar;na 4,5 jaar relatie.... 😇&rpar;'
'Ga gewoon niet dan!'
'Ja ik denk het ook wel'
'Nee dat snap ik wel haha'
'Ja wel prima. Nog wat gewerkt en voetbal gekeken'
'Ja zelfs ook nog..'
'Ja soms wel. Maar ik ben geen verwend joch geworden.'
'Maar, welke dj was dat dan?'
'Hmm, die ken ik nog niet. Maar klinkt wel relaxed'
'Hmm lastig... Waar houd je niet van?'
'Ja dat denk ik ook wel'
'Maar dit past ook wel goed ja'
'Ook lekker! Met poedersuiker?'
'Uuh... Nou, binnenkort wel! Working on it 😇'
'En wat tof dat je dat doet.\nIk wil daar ook bewuster mee om gaan. Ik ben al flink terug geschaald, en de volgende stap is 2 of 3 keer per week geen vlees.'
'Ja hele toffe reis gehad 😊😊 en dan uiteraard nog heel veel over land wat je daar niet uit kan halen.'
'Ik slaap veel te goed de afgelopen dagen'
'Hoe was je date?'
'En maandag weer gewerkt'
'Oh, en vandaag naar de kapper geweest'
'2 meisjes versierd 🙈'
'Waren de twee van jou ook vrienden?'
'Heb je daar nog nooit van gehoord?'
'Nee ik ook niet'
'Dat is balen'
'Dat hangt ervanaf af wat die jongen zoekt..'
'Goede vraag. Daar heb ik helemaal nog niet op die manier over nagedacht'
'Maar die tweede was toch wel prettig'
'Oh nee 🙈'
'Ik heb 5 vriendinnetjes gehad.'
'En dat heb ik nog nooit aan iemand verteld'
'Wat versta je onder seks? Penetratie of ook het voorspel al?'
'In jouw verhaal was wel alles op seks?'
'Dan val ik nog mee? 😃'
'Je kan nu ook niet meer teug 😅'
'Die huisgenoot. Was dat een vriend van hem?'
'Nou moet ik wel zeggen, dat ik heel goed kan leiden. Maar ik volg af en toe graag 🤔'
'Daar is de afwisseling weer'
'Oh dat is ook niet erg positief'
'Moet ik maar doen alsof ik van niks weet? 😇'
'Ja oké, dat mag wel😇😇'
'Nobel!'
'Dat klinkt wel gaaf!'
'Nu wat minder liefs..'
'Oh nee hoor, dat niet.'
'Maar zo slim is die jongen niet.. 😅'
'Haha, ja dat is soms ook wel waar inderdaad..'
'Nu weer onderweg naar huis?'
'Do before you die dingen..'
'Nu ook denk ik wel..'
'Nee, ik mag nog niet slapen'
'Maar ik slaap al 2 weken niet geweldig 🙈'
'Okee dan😊'
'Één huisdier?'
'Wat een leuke poes!'
'Des te leuker'
'En wie is Manu'
'Oh, dus is alweer weg?'
'Nou okee dan 👶'
'Oei, en hoe laat had je afgesproken?'
'Maar wel leuk!'
'Goed!\nGisteren twee vrienden over de vloer gehad. Stadje in geweest, was om 8 uur thuis 😅'
'Kook je graag?'
'Oh, en knoflook. Dat ken ik ook'
'Maar ik ben aan het bedenken of ik er een wil kijken waar ik ook wat van kan leren.'
'Ja...\nIk weet niet of dat positief of negatief is 😇'
'Vroeg naar bed vanavond...'
'Okee'
'Agreed!'
'Dat klinkt goed!'
'Ja, ik ben alweer aan het werk'
'Welke drugs gebruik je dan?'
'Ja, dat merk ik wel 😇\nNiks mis mee verder hoor. 😊'
'Ik heb er nu in totaal 5 leuke gesprekspartners aan over gehouden. Maarja, 2 kende ik al 😂'
'Oeh en nog een leuke vraag, hoe vaak heb jij dat je niemand meer mag liken op 1 dag?'
'Massive attack? Ken ik helemaal niet 🙈\nNou ben ik sowieso niet heel goed in al die artiesten namen..'
'Inderdaad heel lekker'
'2 of 3 weken...?'
'Maar, was het het waard? Zo&apos;n geniale avond? 😁'
'Is er nog wat gebeurt met die jongen die je jouw verkeerde nummer had gegeven?'
'Is daar verder nog wat mee gebeurt, sinds het diner?'
'Lucky you... I guess?\nAan de andere kant, dam gebruik je wel sneller dat soort dingen.. Tja..'
'Ga je nog daten vandaag?'
'Ja druk ben ik ook ja 😅 veel deadlines komende weken'
'Kasteel Sterkenburg. Google maar 😇'
'Bedankt nog en goedemorgen alweer'
'Ik ook hier hoor, behalve 1 wereldreis 🙈'
'Donkerbruine krullen? Mooi😍'
'Ik snap heel goed wat je bedoeld'
'Geen shottos, of de stoof en dat soort dingen?'
'Oh, en wat ik ook graag doe. Is lekker in badje relaxen. En dat is ook precies wat ik nu even ga doen 🤗'
'Zo, dat had lullig geweest'
'Nou, jawel. 2 jaar terug. Toen zat ik in Bali'
'Nee sowieso geef je daar geen nee tegen!'
'Lekker warm bedje. Heb ik stiekem ook wel zin in'
'Ja klopt. Lekker spontaan 😅'
'Ah, lekker gemiddeld 😁'

'Super tof die feestjes. Dat moet ik toch ook maar weer een keer wat meer gaan doen denk ik'
'Zuid Amerika wil ik ook nog heel graag heen!'
'Ja dat hoop ik ook ja😁'
'Oké, daar kan ik weinig tegenin brengen'
'Ja... Dat droop er vanaf 😅'
'Urgentie gesprekken? Mensen die met nood een woning nodig hebben?'
'Nee oké dat snap ik wel'
'En dat geloof ik ook wel, haha'
'Ah, live and let live Nan. Lekker laten gaan die mensen'
'En omdat ik het leuk vond dat ik jou tegen kwam. Ik heb al wel vaker leuke gesprekken met jou gehad, en die wilde ik wel weer opnieuw aangaan 😊'
'Ook dat geloof ik heel graag 😂'
'Ja. Dat vlak...'
'Ik kan het ook 😃'
'Is ook stukken beter 😁'
'Mannen oppikken hoeft tegenwoordig niet meer in de stad, kan ook via Tinder5'
'Of een stalker'
